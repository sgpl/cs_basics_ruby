## 1.1 introduction

programming != computer science

cs is not language centric. more about using language to solve particular problems. 

program is a set of instructions that the computer uses to solve a real proble,. 

comp. scientists strive to create a correct sequence of steps that minimize resource demands and operate in a timely fashion yielding correct results. 

alogrithms expresses using pseudocode, that specifies the logical, conceptual steps that must occur without specifying the necessary details needed to actually execute each step. 

## 1.2 application development

computer does exactly what you want it to do. 

eg: make a sandwich is intutive for humans, but computer needs explicit instructions. 

>> computer science is ultimately about problem solving: 
1. understand the problem
2. write out soln. in plain language
3. translate language to code
4. test code in the computer. 

## 1.3 algorithms

step by step method of solving problems
