## 1.1 introduction

programming != computer science

cs is not language centric. more about using language to solve particular problems. 

program is a set of instructions that the computer uses to solve a real proble,. 

comp. scientists strive to create a correct sequence of steps that minimize resource demands and operate in a timely fashion yielding correct results. 

alogrithms expresses using pseudocode, that specifies the logical, conceptual steps that must occur without specifying the necessary details needed to actually execute each step. 

## 1.2 application development

computer does exactly what you want it to do. 

eg: make a sandwich is intutive for humans, but computer needs explicit instructions. 

>> computer science is ultimately about problem solving: 
1. understand the problem
2. write out soln. in plain language
3. translate language to code
4. test code in the computer. 

## 1.3 algorithms

step by step method of solving problems

different algorithms vary in efficiency

> Algorithm efficiency: A measurement that determines how efficient one algorithm is compared with another.

## 1.4 summary

tldr of chapter. 

critical to remember that independent of prog. language, w/o a good algorithm, solutions will be ineffective. 


### key concepts: 

- cs is about problem solving
- computer is never wrong, it is merely implementing your directions


### exercise soln: 

#### 1. 
a. **2 

b. **

#### 2. 
a. ((1+n)/2.0)*n

b. I think that (a.) satisfies the criteria. 

#### 3. 
- first element = last element
- second element = second-last element
- repeat till single middle element (for odd) or middle two elements equal to each other (for even)

#### 4. 

 TO DO. NOT SURE ATM.

#### 5. 
a. The purpose of this algorithm is to figure out the amount of change due to the customer given the cost of a product and the money paid. 

b. gist: 
- 'C', the change due = money paid - cost
- keep giving the customer $1 till C >= 1
- keep giving the customer $0.25 till C >= 0.25
- keep giving the customer $0.10 till C >= 0.10
- keep giving the customer $0.05 till C >= 0.05
- keep giving the customer $0.01 till C >= 0.01
- the program then ends. 

 

#### 6. 

Engineer's algo. doesn't work because it creates a loop for the '1' weighted cables.
